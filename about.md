When I have a question or idea I want to explore further, I write it down either on a page titled "Questions" or a page titled "Cracked Theories", depending on how well-formed or absurd it is.

When I find an interesting webpage, I bookmark it to come back to later, as one does.

Between "Questions", "Cracked Theories", and my bookmarks, I have over 100 questions and 300 webpages I need to get back to. 

Come on this journey with me! Every week starting Dec. 15th, I'm writing a short article on one of these things in my backlog. It's like a study vlog, except instead of watching me do homework for college you get to read about me doing homework just for fun.
